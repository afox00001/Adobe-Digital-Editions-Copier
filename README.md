# Adobe Digital Editions Copier
This takes a photo of each page of the E-book, then saves them to a PDF.

I created this because my school would often give us an E-copy of books that would take a week to read, but would expier in 3 days or so.

The code is a bit of a mess, i made it in a hurry (about an hour or so) so its not that clean, and i did not see a reason to clean it up.

In order to use it, you have to have Adobe Digital Editions open in your main screen, then run the script. It uses PyautoGUI to interact with Adobe Digital Editions, and to take screen shots.

NOTE: THIS IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!! DO THIS AT YOUR ON RISK!
